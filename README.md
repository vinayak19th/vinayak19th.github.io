**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

### Known Bugs:
- [ ] Issue with dark mode button position on Ipad: Only seems to be seen with Ipads. 

Would appreciate contributions towards these bug fixes


### Docker

If you have docker installed you can simply run `docker-compose up` to launch the site in a container, it will then be hosted at `http://localhost:4000`

## Installation & setup guide
This template is designed to be hosted using GitHub pages and so that's what these instructions will cover. If you plan on hosting it seperately then there might be some extra steps that we wont cover.

Before starting it might be useful to familiarise yourself with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Step 1 - GitHub
Start by creating an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join)

### Step 2 - Fork and clone
Fork this repository (helps with awareness and contributions) and clone it on your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io.git
```

or download the source code from [releases](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/releases/)
### Step 3 - Create your repository

Create a repository on GitHub to host your website. You can find out how to do that [here](https://pages.github.com/)

*tl;dr (Highly encourage reading the official docs though)*
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
where username should be your GitHub ID and **copy over <u>all</u> the content from this repository**

> **If you do not have a custom domain, delete the CNAME file**


## Deployment

### Step 1 : Local static generation
You can generate your entire website locally using :
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
This will generate the website and run a local server to view the website


***Note:** The first time the command runs it will be much slower due to needing to pull and build the image. It will be much faster on every subsequent call*

### Step 2 : Hosting
Commit and push the resume template to github to host
```
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Initial resume setup"
$ git push -u origin master
```
### Step 5 - See it
You should now be able to see the demo resume template using this theme at `[your-username].github.io`

### Step 6 - Setting a custom domain
If you own a custom domain, modify the [cname](./CNAME) file with your own custom

# Usage

So now you will be able to see the demo template at your github URL. You can can edit the yml files and replace the demo content with your own. Hopefully it will be fairly simple to work out where all the content goes, but here is a quick overview.

## `_config.yml`
This will contain all the of the main configuration for your resume such as your name, email, social media links and about me content. It also contains all the content for your resume.  
A full example of the _config.yml can be found [here](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml)

**Main config options:**

1. Personal info:
    * Replace all the personal info in this section
    * This will automatically update the following:
        * Navbar home button
        * Home page terminal animation
        * Header on ever page
    * Ignore the darkmode toggle
2. Social Links:
    * Replace all the personal info in this section
    * This will automatically update the following:
        * All buttons in the header and homepage
    * If **githubstats** is set to any value and not commented out, **github_username** will generate all the GitHub statics on the about page
3. About Section:
    * Replace all the personal info in this section
    * This will automatically update the following:
        * The **profile image** and **favicon** needs to be stored in the images folder of your repo and will update your favicon and Profile picture on the about page
        * **about_content** only populates your about page

> DON'T MODIFY ANYHTING ELSE HERE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

## Content
The main content for you resume will all come under the content property in the `_config.yml` file. This can be quite complex and a good understanding on [YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) will be helpful here.

### `_data` Folder

The [_data](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/tree/master/_data) folder contains  files for all the main pages ie : [education,experience,pages,etc].

> Adding entries in the exact format as in the samples will automatically populate the **webpages** 

**Main config options:**
1. General Notes:
    * Do not change the layout unless you want really messed up front end
    * You **CAN** leave fields blank without too much trouble
    * Add **NEW** fields **WILL NOT** automatically update them into pages. You will need to modify the respective [layout](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/tree/master/_includes/layout) to have them appear. Refer to the Jekyll documentation.
2. [education.yml](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/education.yml):
    * Basic options
    * Only updates the about page
3. [experience_edu.yml](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/experience_edu.yml):
    * Used to highlight things like *committee* & *club* memberships in college
    * Can use doc links for certificates
4. [experience.yml](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/experience.yml):
    * Used to show **professional** positions such as jobs and internships 
    * Can use doc links for LOR's etc
5. [projects.yml](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/projects.yml):
    * Used to populate your projects on GitHub
    * You have to add a Github link by just using username/repo-name in the **github** field
    * The repo cards and stats will be **updated automatically** by this change
7. [awards](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/awards):
    * Used to list achievements
    * You can add a seperate non-tech yml file to include those
    * Added to about page
8. [certification](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/certification):
    * **Most complex to understand**
    * The files in this folder are used **populate the tabs** in the certification page
    * The addition of tabs is automatic and based on the name of the file you create
    * All details in the files within are reproduced on their own
    * **Only supports the providers** Coursera and edX right now, feel free to add more and submit a PR
    * **CANNOT LEAVE PROVIDERS EMPTY**
9. [pages.yml](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/pages.yml):
    * Used to populate the navbar.
    * Leave it unchanged unless you are adding new pages
10. [papers.bib](https://github.com/vinayak19th/vinayak19th.github.io/blob/master/_data/papers.bib):
    * Directly add your publications here in bibtex format. 
    * Add a `tag` entry in the bibitem to create a filterable tag based system  

You can simply replace the data in the yml files to really quickly build up your website.


***Note:** The description or content areas (fields starting with `| #`) use markdown, this means that you have the ability to format the section in many different ways and add things such as images, code & syntax highlighting and tables. You can find a good [Markdown cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)*
