      A scalable approach to preserving the privacy of bystanders in social media posts :<br>
      * Entirely '*edge*' system tested on low end android phones-
      * Client side nature makes it scalable as no server compute required for new nodes,
      * Edge compute improves privacy as unfiltered data never leaves the device
      * Aesthetics are preserved via custom filter implementation based on human tendecies
